# Welcome to Breadboard Computer

This is a learning project that attempts to recreate [Ben Eater's Breadboard Computer](https://eater.net/8bit) within an FPGA. It is not new news to build a CPU within an FPGA, but Ben's project inspired me to learn about FPGA's with a concrete example and goal in mind.

This project is based on the [Alchitry Au](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16527) and [Alchitry IO Element](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16525) boards. The Alchitry Labs IDE is used to build and deploy the solution, but I have included the bin files in case you want to use the [Alchitry loader](https://github.com/alchitry/alchitry-loader/) to simply upload the solution to your board.

Instructional videos will follow that will describe the build. Stay tuned...
